At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I can't remember this regulation if I tried
Things like FATCA and DODD FRANK
AIFMD and more
So many boring regulations in acronym to confuse you more
<br>

So now I'm back, FATCA and DODD
You're rules for investors and Fund managers across the world
ANNEX IV is a new report
That you gotta fill out by yourself
Within ten little business days
It's gonna stress you out

<br>
AIFMD, the hardest one of all
ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGER DIRECTIVE
Now you're embedded in my head
You've got no place to go
You'll forever live in my brain
In a Gloria Gaynor song
